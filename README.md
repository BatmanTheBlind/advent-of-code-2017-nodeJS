# Advent of Code 2017
Node JS scripts to solve puzzle of http://adventofcode.com/2017/

# How to run ?
You need to install node js on your computer (v 8.9.1 recommanded)

Then execute `node day[x]/index.js` where `[x]` is the day of the puzzle

Example :
```
node day1/index.js
```

If you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can also hit `F5` when you have one of the script open to run it with debugger (usefull to add some breakpoint and understand how the code works)
